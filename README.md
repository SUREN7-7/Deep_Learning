                                                Neural Network
A Neural Network is a machine learning model inspired by how the human brain works. It's used to learn patterns from data and make predictions, like:
-> Recognizing images (e.g., "Is this a cat or a dog?")
-> Understanding text (e.g., sentiment analysis)
-> Predicting numbers (e.g., stock prices or marks)

                                            Basic Building Blocks
1. Neuron (Node)
The smallest unit.
It takes input(s), does a weighted sum + applies an activation function, and gives an output.

2. Layers
There are 3 main types:
(*) Input Layer	Takes input data (e.g., features of a student)
(*) Hidden Layer(s)	Learn patterns/features in data
(*) Output Layer	Gives final prediction (e.g., pass/fail)

3. Working of a Neural Network
(*) Input: Hours studied, attendance, assignments submitted.
(*) Weighted Sum: Each input has a "weight" (importance) â†’ multiplied and added.
(*) Activation: A function (like ReLU or sigmoid) decides whether the neuron "fires".
(*) Output: The final result (e.g., marks out of 100 or pass/fail).
